# CodSoft Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my **CodSoft Machine Learning Internship**. Each project focuses on a different real-world machine learning problem, utilizing various algorithms and techniques to build predictive models.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository consists of the following projects:
### 1️⃣ Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Created a fraud detection model for credit card transactions.
- Used an imbalanced dataset to classify fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
- Applied machine learning techniques such as **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest**.
- 📌 Files: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and a file containing the dataset link.
  
### 2️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction
- Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based business.
- Utilized historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics.
- Experimented with algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- 📌 Files: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and dataset.

### 3️⃣ Spam SMS Detection
- Built a classification model to detect spam messages in SMS texts.
- Used **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and machine learning algorithms.
- Implemented **TF-IDF vectorization** and applied models like Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- 📌 Files: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) and dataset.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Spam Detection**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Naïve Bayes, etc.)**
